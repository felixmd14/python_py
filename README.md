# Solution

- As per the moderator's instructions, the project was to be solved with collections and loops.
- In this instance, I used lists and the while loop to find the answers to the questions.
- The comments in the code are a lot but they are there to guide anyone (esp. beginners) who needs a step by step work through to make sense of my work.
